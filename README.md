# Machine-Learning-Algorithms
On this project we used the IMDB dataset and implemented the Naive Bayes and Logistical Regression algorithms from scratch 
in order to train the algorithms on the classification of a movie review based on the words it contains into a positive one or a negative one.
(You can also read our report to see our results)


To run the code simply:


1)Downlad the aclImdb dataset : https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/aclImdb_v1.tar.gz


2)Unzip it


3)Place the aclImdb folder in the Text_Classification folder of this project.


4)Run the code.
